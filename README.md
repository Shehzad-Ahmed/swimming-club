Web Application Programming Assignment

You have been approached by College Road Swimming Club to create a new Swim Club Membership Management web application to include presentation of swim performance data. Club admin officials, coaches, parents and swimmers all need access to the system with varying levels of access and with some able to enter, update and view personal details, gala results and swim records.

•	Club administrators, parents and swimmers will be allowed to access different levels of content depending on their authorization level.  
•	All users wish to be able to investigate individual swimmer performance over time and compare them to other relevant swimmers in the club 
•	Non-adult swimmers will not be able to edit their personal details, 
•	Adult swimmers and parents of swimmers are expected to maintain their own, or their children’s, personal details. 
•	Coaches can view and edit squad details and their swimmers training performance data
•	Only club administrators can edit and validate race data
